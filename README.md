[CertCRM](https://cert-crm.herokuapp.com/) is a tool for managing customers' certificates. Clone the project and replace the `<main>` in `./frontend/HomePageContainer.js` with your company's website. CertCRM provides a floating footer that will let you access an admin UI, where you can:

* search for customers
* deactivate or reactivate certificates

* create new certificates

* create new customers
* delete old ones
